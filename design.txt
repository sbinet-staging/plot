Design of ggplot2 for Go
========================

Data Input
----------

Data input is either Slice-Of-Measurements (SOM) of the form

    type Measurement struct {
        Age    int
        Weight float64
        Height float64
        Born   time.Time
	Gender string
    }
    func (m Measurement) BMI() float64 {
        return m.Weight/(m.Height*m.Height)
    }

    var data []Measurement

or of the Collection-Of-Slices (COS) form
    
    type Measurement struct {
        Age    []int
        Weight []float64
        Height []float64
        Born   []time.Time
        Gender []string
    }
    func (m Measurement) BMI(i int) float64 {
        return m.Weight[i]/(m.Height[i]*m.Height[i])
    }

    var data Measurement

Both forms are converted to a Data Frame which is basically a generic
representation in the COS form. It resembles a R data frame.


Plot Creation
-------------

Plot Creation is the following process:
  
  1.  Split data according to facetting specification.
      Happens only on facetted plots, each facett is basically
      treated as its own plot and represented as a panel.
      Result: A n x m data frames in Domain Units, original field names

  2a. Some or all fields are mapped to aestetics.
      The mapped fields are transformed according to the
      scale transformation (identitiy, log, sqrt, 1/x, ...)
      Result: Data frame in Domain Units, unmapped fields have
      original field names, other have the mapped aes name.
      Only add "known" scales to the plot: During this stage
      we might want to keep columns in the original data frame
      so that the statistical transform can use these columns.
  2b. Pre-Train Scales. Usefull if upcumming stat wants to knows what
      the full x-range will be.

  3.  A statistical transform is applied, typically some kind of
      summary statistics like binning, boxplot or smoothing.
      Result: A completely new data frame with new field names.
      (Or the original input if no stat is requested.)

  4a. Some (typically new) fields might be mapped to (new) aestetics.
      Scale transformations are performed during this mapping.
  4b. Rename fields to match expected input from Geom in next step.
      Result: A data frame with field names suitable to be rendered
      as a specific Geom.

  5a. Apply position adjustments to geoms located at the same x-coordinate.
  5b. Reparametrise Geoms. E.g. change description of a rectangle
      from <centerX, centerY, Width, Height> to (xmin,ymin, xmax,ymax).
      Reperametrise complex or domain specific geoms to a few
      basic, primitive geoms.
      Result: One (TODO: or several?) data frames in Domain Units
      with field names suitable for primitive geoms.

  6.  Train scales: Find min/max or set of levels accross layers and
      facetts.

  7.  Uses these scales to render geoms into Grobs (Graphical Objects).
      Result: Structure of Grobs, coordinates/values in Range Units.

  8a. Apply Coordinate Transformations: Interprete <x,y> pairs in
      a Grob eg. as <y,x> (flip coordinates), as <r,Ï‘> (polar coordiantes)
      or <x,-y> (reversed y) and so on.
      Interpolate lines by lots of small segemnts.
  8b. Render into Viewport.

  9.  Render Guides (Axes and Legends), render rest (title, facett boxes).


Statistical Transforms
----------------------
Basic idea is dead simple. Take one data frame and construct an other data
frame which summarizes/describes the original one.

Only complication: What to do if the input data frame contains more
slots/fields than the stat can operate on?  Example: StatBin needs
"x" and can use optional "weight". What to do if extra field "Gender"
is present in input data frame?
The following may happen:
  -  Completely ignore the additional fields, pretend they are just
     not there.
  -  Fail. Do not process such data.
  -  Group (facett) input data on the additional field(s) if the
     additional fields are discrete.
Ignore and fail are simple; grouping n the StatBin with extra Gender example:
Split input data frame into two frames Gender=='f' and Gender=='m'
apply Simple StatBin to both and combine both results afterwards to something
like
       x  count density Gender
       5     0    0.0     m
      10     6    0.2     m 
      15    11    0.4     m
      20     9    0.3     m
       5     2    0.1     f
      10     5    0.2     f
      15    15    0.5     f
      20     0    0.0     f

The fields x and Gender where present in the input to StatBin, the fields
count and density (also ncount and ndensity) are new fields.
Gender is passed through pretty much unchanged while x is aggregated,
here the center of the bins, i.e. none of the resulting x might occur
in the input data frame.

Statistical transforms cannot be chained.


Aesthetics Mapping
------------------

Mapping of Aesthetics may happen before and after statistical transform.
Example StatBin: x must be mapped before (as StatBin needs x as input)
while mapping the generated count to y can happen only after computing
the stat.

What happens if one of the known real aesthetics is mapped:
  -  The field in the data frame is renamed to the aesthetics
     (e.g. BMI is replaced by y)
  -  A scale is added for this aesthetics if not present in the plot.
     Depending on the type of the data frame field this might be continous
     or discrete.
  -  The scale is pre-trained: TODO: really here? not own phase?


Complications, differences from ggplot2 for R
---------------------------------------------
All of the following do _not_ produce points for the calculated bins:
  ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=x)) + stat_bin() + geom_point()
  ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=x)) + stat_bin(aes(y=..count..)) + geom_point()
  ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=x)) + stat_bin(aes(y=..count..)) + geom_point(count=count)
  ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=x)) + stat_bin(aes(y=..count..)) + geom_point(y=..count..)
  ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=x)) + stat_bin(aes(y=..count..)) + geom_point(y=count)
  ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=x)) + stat_bin(aes(y=..count..)) + geom_point(y=count)
  ... and so on.
The ggplot2 way of doing this is by use of
  ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=x)) + stat_bin(aes(y=..count..), geom="point")
which is pretty straight forward for an interactive tool but does not
fit well into a prepared plot with fixed layers, stats and geoms.


Grobs, Graphical Objects
------------------------

Grobs are the primitive building blocks for graphics
  -  Points.   <x,y, style, size, color, alpha>
  -  Text.     <x,y, text, color, size, v-/h-align, font, alpha>
  -  Lines.    <x0,y0,x1,y1,...,xn,yn, style, color, size/width>
  -  Polygon   <x0,y0,x1,y1,...,xn,yn, fill, alpha>
  -  Rectangle <xmin,ymin, xmax,ymax, style, color, width, fill, alpha>
  -  Container <xmin,ymin, xmax,ymax>
All grob coordinates are in the interval [0,1]. Container group grobs
and provide a convenient way to reparam different grobs of e.g. one geom.

TODO: Rectangle Needed? Achievable through Grob-Reparametrisation of
Polygon but may be convenient...



Boxplot
-------

Maybe the most complex stuff. If this works everythings should be fine.

Prerequisite:
  - Some discrete field is mapped to x.
  - Some field is mapped to y.
  - Other fields may be mapped to color, fill, linetype

Statistical transform:
  - Partition input data by color, fill and linetype. 
  - For each partition:
      * Group on the discrete x values
      * For each group compute min, low, med, high, max
        (and the outliers) based on the set of ys.
      * Return DF with (x, min,q1,median,q3,max)
  - Combine partitions to single DF which might look like
    (x, min,q1,median,q3,max, color, linetype)

Geom construction:
  - Wire generated stat fields to geom input fields, e.g.
    rename q1-->low, median-->mid, q3-->high
  - For same-x entries in the DF: Apply position adjustments.
    The only sane here is dodging, but nevertheless, why not
    stack them....
  - While building the geom: Train the scales, especially
    the y scale.
  - Produce a set of "Basic-Geoms" which biject to grobs and
    do not need a reparametrisation: Produce rectangle,
    vertical lines, horizontal median and outlier dots.
    

Grob construction:
  - All scales should be trained now, prepare projection
    functions.
  - Use projection functions to turn values in the different
    geoms to real grobs in viewport coordinates.
